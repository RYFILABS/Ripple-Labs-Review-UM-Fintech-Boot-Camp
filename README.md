[6:52 AM] Ripple Labs Review

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company - Ripple Labs, Inc.

* When was the company incorporated? 2012

* Who are the founders of the company? Chris Larsen, Jed McCaleb, Ryan Fugger

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

In 2004 while Ryan Fugger was working for a local exchange in Vancouver he conceived the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money.
Fugger later built the first version of this system and called it RipplePay.com. Meanwhile in May 2011 Jed McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by Bitcoin.
In 2012 McCaleb along with Chris Larsen then approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency concept and Fugger gave them control.
Later that year Larsen and McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin and began development of the ripple protocol, and the payment and exchange network.
In 2013, OpenCoin officially changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

The primary source of funding has been sales of Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency. According to Ripple's records it sold $1,254,540,000 worth of XRP between 2016 and 2020.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Ripple is trying to build a more inclusive financial system. Allowing for real-time payments for their customers using their leading blockchain network solution. This allows for much faster local and cross-border payments.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Their intended customers are innovative financial institutions that are looking to scale their payment businesses. Current customers include firms such as Bank of America, American Express, Santander, MoneyMatch, GoLance, TransferGo, and many others.
The global financial services market size is about $20 trillion. Most of these institutions could benefit from Ripple's payment network.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

In contrast to other crypto firms, Ripple works within the existing financial system to improve not disrupt. They partner with these institutions to streamline their underlying infrastructure not replace it.
They also work with regulators, governments, and central banks to ensure their solutoins are complient.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing
  you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

RippleNet - Their world leading global payments system which they are implementing into the existing infrastructure of financial institutions to provide solutions to the customers of those institutions.
  
Crypto Line of Credit - Eligible institutions can offer their customers a Ripple Line of Credit where they can offer XRP to their customers to complete instant, low-cost cross-border transfers.

ODL - On Demand Liquidity through RippleNet leverages XRP as a bridge between 2 currencies, eliminating pre-funding destination accounts, reducing operational costs, and unlocking capital.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Payment systems, cross-border payments and transfers, loans and capital funding, cryptocurrency.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

In the crypto domain there have been significant strides in adoption both on the side of financial institutions and businesses beginning to trust and implement these new methods of payment.

In the money transfer domain, competitive companies are doing everything possible to reduce transfer costs and delivery time. Innovations that have spawned from this are money transfer apps such as Zelle, CashApp, Venmo and others.

People are tired of paying inflated fees to transfer money while having to wait a ridiculous amount of time in the real-time world we are now living in.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

In the crypto space you have other examples such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. but the most similar to Ripple's system is Stellar.

In the money transfer/payment domain you have players such as Western Union, MoneyGram, Xoom from Paypal, and others.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

The business impact of this company so far has been reducing the cost and lead time of transfers for people while allowing payments to be sent cross-borders with far more ease than what was previously considered to be the norm.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

User base, implementation of their technology, crypto market cap.

Ripple's userbase is steadily growing as more and more businesses begin to implement their tech. From large financial institutions to smaller money transfer companies, their network is growing consistently.

XRP market cap sits at roughly $42,000,000,000 at the time of this writing.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

The only other real competitor to Ripple is Stellar which utilizes much of the same technology. Ripple is far outperforming Stellar from an implementation and usability standpoint.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would recommend that they develop their own payment/transfer app in conjunction with what they are developing with financial institutions.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

If they were to develop an app similar to CashApp, Venmo, etc. they would be able to capture the market of micropayments, microloans etc.
This would benefit their brand, increase awareness, and incentivize further implementation from large financial institutions.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

A mobile application which allows for users to deposit, send, and receive payments. Perhaps even allow users to earn a small percentage on any funds they keep depositied within the app.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies would only further develop the Ripple network. They would allow for individuals to benefit from their payment/transfer system without having to be affiliated with a large financial institution to utilize Ripple's network and services.
